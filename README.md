RainbowDashboard
================

[RainbowDashboard](https://github.com/kreativekorp/rainbowdash/wiki/RainbowDashboard) is a third-party firmware for the Rainbowduino by Seeed Studio. Among its features:

  * Clean, maintainable code base.
  * Compatible with standard firmware from Rainbowduino 2.0.
  * Supports UART mode (no Arduino host needed - talk to Rainbowduino directly).
  * **Works with both Rainbowduino 2.0 and Rainbowduino 3.0.**
  * Double-buffered graphics operations.
  * Software real-time clock.
  * Animation driven by the Rainbowduino itself.
  * Full Windows ANSI (CP1252) character set. (Technically [Kreative SuperLatin](http://www.kreativekorp.com/charset/encoding.php?name=Kreative+SuperLatin), a superset.)
  * High-level command set.

The RainbowDashboard project also encompasses [RainbowStudio](https://github.com/kreativekorp/rainbowdash/wiki/RainbowStudio), a graphical front-end application for controlling Rainbowduinos. Using RainbowStudio, you can upload firmware without the Arduino IDE, drive a display, emulate a virtual Rainbowduino, and edit RBD (RainbowDashboard command stream) files.
